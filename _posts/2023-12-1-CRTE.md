## Introduction

Nowadays, Windows Active Directory (AD) is used to administer the networks of almost every organizationüòÅ, thus it's critical for a security expert to be aware of the risks to the Windows architecture.Active Directory is an ever-growing beast with new exploits and abuses discovered regularlyüòë. Learning how to use this to your advantage as a penetartion tester or even as a red teamer has a lot more practical use cases than any point-and-shoot exploit that could be developed and released.


## Course
This course is developed by (**Nikhil Mittal**) at Altered Security.The focus of the CRTE course is on the use of offensive PowerShell and open-source tools to enumerate and exploit Active Directory. it‚Äôs major selling point is in the living-off-the-land approach to Active Directory penetration testing.The course conist of Theortical part (14-hours of video contents+PDFs) and Practical Part (Over 300 of tortureüò•) 

The course outline is the following:

#### Offensive Side:
* Offensive Powershell
* Domain Enumeration
* Local Privilege Escalation
* PowerShell Remoting (and WinRS)
* Domain Privilege Escalation
* Lateral Movement
* Offensive .NET
* Domain Persistence
* Cross Trust Attacks
* Cross Forest Attacks

#### Defensive Side
* Protect and Limit Domain Admins
* Isolate administrative workstations
* Secure local administrators
* Time bound and just enough administration
* Isolate administrators in a separate forest and breach containment using
* Tiers and ESAE

One thing you might notice is that the section on defense and detection is quite larger than the (**CRTP**). This is an interesting feature, but it's not the course's primary selling point as the course focus more in the red part but it's good for blue teams to gain some knowlege on the red mindset and how to defend against it.

## Labs

I really enjoyed working my way through the lab environment and getting to leverage abuses that I haven't really had a chance to use up until now.As the CRTP the lab is accessable either through VPN or through RDP access over Guacamole.The lab simulates real world attack-defense scenarios and require you to start with a non-admin user account in the domain and work your way up to enterprise admin of multiple forests. The focus is on exploiting the variety of overlooked domain features and not just software vulnerabilities.The architecture of the lab can be viewed below.
